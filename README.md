# Smart India Hackathon 2024 - Multimodal RAG System


---

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

**Project Title:** "IntelliSearch Pro - Unified Multimodal RAG Intelligence System"

**Problem Statement:** Traditional search tools struggle with cross-format understanding, isolating text, image, and audio searches. Organizations need a unified system that can seamlessly search and retrieve information across PDFs, images, audio recordings, and documents while providing transparent citations and cross-modal connections.

**Our Solution:** A complete offline-first multimodal RAG system that ingests, indexes, and intelligently retrieves information across all data formats using advanced AI models, providing grounded responses with full citation transparency.
